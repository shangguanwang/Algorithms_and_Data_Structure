# Matrix Spiral

1. create the empty matrix structure. Create a value variable and set it to 1, will increment this value every time.

2. Create 4 variables that keep track of the start column, end column, start row, end row. will use a while loop and change those values to constrain the matrix area we are looking at.

3. Inside the while loop, we want 4 for loops to take care of each side.
