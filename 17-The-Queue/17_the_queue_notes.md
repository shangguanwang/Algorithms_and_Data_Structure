# Queue

### Data Structures
Definition: ways of organizing information with optimal runtime complexity for adding or removing records.

### The Queue Data Structure

record enters the container on one side and exit on the other side. It's like a waiting line of ticketing counter. First in first out: no cut in line.

**Array equivalent method of a queue:**
- Create a new empty queue: const q = new Queue();
- Add to queue: array.unshift() | q.add(1);
- Remove from queue: array.pop() | q.remove();
